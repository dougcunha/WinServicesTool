Formatting and style standards for this C# project:

## For writing code:

- 4-space indentation.
- Always use a blank line between code blocks (methods, properties, constructors, etc).
- Always add a blank line before if, for, foreach, and return.
- Always add a blank line after opening or before closing braces.
- Use expression-bodied members and start a new line before =>
- When calling a method with more than 4 arguments, chop the arguments so that each argument is written on its own line, 
the opening parenthesis of the method call or lambda expression must be placed on a new line after the method name. 
Additionally, if an argument uses a lambda expression or a nested call with its own parentheses, apply the same rule recursively.
- Constant names in UPPER_CASE.
- Use var when the type is obvious.
- XMLDoc is mandatory for public classes and methods.
- Non-inheritable classes must be sealed.
- DRY: avoid code repetition.
- Write code always in english.
- Use modern collections and initializers ([] and [..] when possible).
- Add <inherited /> for inherited members in XMLDoc.
- Always put using before namespace declaration and sort them alphabetically.
- Use `nameof` operator instead of hardcoded strings for member names.
- Make anonymous function static when possible.
- Keep always one class per file.
- Use `string.Equals` with `StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase` for case-insensitive comparisons.
- Use `StringBuilder` for string concatenation in loops or large concatenations.
- Use .ConfigureAwait(false) for async methods to avoid deadlocks except in Windows Forms applications.
- Use `CancellationToken` for long-running operations to allow cancellation.

## For saving and loading configurations:

- Use JSON format for configuration files.
- Use System.Text.Json for serialization and deserialization.
- Use databinding to bind configuration properties to UI elements.
- Validate configuration data before applying it.

## For writing tests:

- Use xUnit, Shouldly and NSubstitute.
- Place ExcludeFromCodeCoverage attribute on all test classes.
- All test classes must be public sealed.
- Use AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) pattern.
- Use Method_Condition_ExpectedResult naming convention for test methods.
- Declare all dependencies as readonly fields and initialize it inline.
- Declare string const as const and use UPPER_CASE for names
- Use raw string to declare multi-line strings
- Avoid using magic strings and numbers, declare them as constants.
- Never try to mock non virtual classes
- If you can't mock a class, use a real instance of it or extract it to an interface.
- Use verbatim strings for file paths and other strings that require escaping.
- Avoid using reflection to access private members, prefer to test public API.
- Do not add unnecessary usings in test files. Use implicit usings when possible.

## For writing documentation:

- Use Markdown for documentation.
- Use proper headings and subheadings.
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity.
- Use code blocks for code snippets.
- Use links for references and further reading.
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes.
- Write always in english.
- Keep a section dedicate to give credits to third-party libraries used in the project.
